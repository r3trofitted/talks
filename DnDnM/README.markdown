# Donjons & Dragons & Modules

These are the slides – or, more accurately, the images exported from the slides – from my talk 
“Donjons & Dragons & Modules”, where I tried to explain Ruby's Object Model as rooms in a classic 
D&D-like donjon, with treasure (data), monsters (methods), inheritence (secret doors), etc. It was 
quite fun!
