### What this talk is about

------

>   The future has imploded into the present. With no nuclear war, the new battlefield is
>   people's minds and souls. Mega-corporations are the new governments; computer-generated 
>   info-domains are the new frontiers. Though there is better living through science and
>   chemistry, we are all becoming cyborgs.
>   
>   The computer is the new cool tool.
>   
>   Though they say all information should be free, it is not.
>   Information is power and currency in the virtual world we
>   inhabit, so mistrust authority.
>   
>   Cyberpunks are the true rebels; cyberculture is coming in under the radar of ordinary
>   society… An unholy alliance of the tech world and the world of organized dissent.

> Certain central themes spring up repeatedly in cyberpunk. Firstly the theme of body invasion, 
> prosthetic limbs, implanted circuitry, cosmetic surgery, genetic alteration. Secondly, 
> mind invasion and mind expansion: brain-computer interfaces, artificial intelligence, 
> neurochemistry - all techniques radically redefining the nature of humanity, the nature of self. 
> For cyberpunk, the computer is much more than an object; it is also an icon and a metaphor that 
> suggests new ways of thinking about ourselves and our new environments, new ways of constructing 
> images of what it means to be human.

------

> Cyberpunk in the real world simply means the Do-It-Yourself attitude coupled with 
> libertarian anarchist politics, projected 20 minutes into the future. It's "garage band"
> or rebel futurism.
